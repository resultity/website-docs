# Fairness Mechanisms

Resultity includes multiple layers of fairness enforcement to maintain trust in a decentralized network where nodes are operated independently by users. These mechanisms balance openness with accountability, ensuring that job execution is honest, consistent, and useful.

## Blind Jobs

The network regularly injects **blind test jobs** into the queue. These jobs:

- Are indistinguishable from regular inference tasks;
- Have known expected outputs or statistical fingerprints;
- Are assigned randomly across the node pool;
- Are not linked to any real client or billing.

Blind jobs are used to:

- Assess output quality and correctness;
- Detect manipulated or low-effort execution;
- Establish per-node quality scores over time.

Failure to perform accurately on blind jobs results in penalties or temporary exclusion from job rotation.

## Response Validation

Each inference result may be subject to:

- **Automated validation**: output structure, token count, latency patterns, GPU consistency;
- **Manual review**: randomly sampled logs, operator audits (especially during testnet);
- **Delayed comparison**: cross-checking multiple responses from replicated jobs.

The network maintains response logs and aggregates historical data to track anomalies or regressions.

## Feedback and Reporting

Clients (developers or integrated systems) may optionally:

- Provide structured feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down, categorization);
- Flag problematic responses for review;
- Participate in reward adjustments (future DAO voting mechanisms).

Feedback is not required but contributes to long-term trust scoring.

## Penalties and Exclusion

Nodes may be temporarily or permanently excluded from job rotation for:

- Repeated failed jobs;
- Invalid or missing signatures;
- Unresponsive behavior;
- Systematic quality degradation.

Penalized nodes receive notifications (via WebSocket or dashboard) and may request reinstatement after cooldown or manual verification.

## Node Scoring (Planned)

Future iterations may include:

- Public or semi-public scoring dashboards;
- Weight-based rotation (better scores = more job opportunities);
- Decentralized voting on node behavior and reward eligibility.

These tools will be governed either by protocol rules or community-voted governance frameworks.

Resultityâ€™s fairness logic is designed to preserve decentralization while discouraging manipulation, rewarding reliability, and enabling scalable trust without direct supervision.
