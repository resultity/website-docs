# Architectural Principles

Resultity is designed with long-term decentralization, auditability, and modularity in mind. While early phases of the platform may rely on centralized coordination for reliability and bootstrapping, the architecture enables progressive migration to community-owned infrastructure and open governance.

This section outlines the core technical and operational principles that guide the design of all platform components.

## API-Centric Design

All interactions with the platform — from job submission to node coordination — occur through clearly defined APIs. This approach ensures:

- Compatibility with developer tools and existing inference frameworks;
- Auditability and traceability of request handling;
- Interoperability across network environments and use cases.

The primary interface is the OpenAI-compatible API, ensuring immediate usability for clients.

## Isolation by Default

Nodes are architected to be fully isolated:

- They do not trust other nodes or communicate directly with peers;
- Execution is sandboxed within the Runtime container;
- All configuration and commands are received from the Network, signed and validated cryptographically.

This isolation allows for fault-tolerance, reproducibility, and security against untrusted peers.

## Controlled Configuration Sync

Node behavior is controlled via centrally issued snapshots, referenced by hash (e.g., `node_config_hash`). This includes:

- Approved models and versions;
- Runtime parameters;
- Network endpoints and timeouts;
- Rules for participation and resource usage.

Nodes periodically check for updated configurations and apply them automatically. Updates may trigger component reloads or model installation.

## Autonomous Updates

The Agent and Runtime components are designed to self-update based on network-issued instructions. Updates include:

- Runtime engine upgrades;
- Model version transitions;
- Container changes for improved performance or compatibility.

All updates are authenticated and version-controlled to prevent unauthorized modification.

## Clear Role Separation

Resultity maintains strict separation between control, execution, and ownership:

- **Accounts** own nodes and credits;
- **Agents** control node behavior;
- **Runtimes** perform model execution;
- **Network** coordinates the system;
- **Cloud** exposes the public interface.

This separation enables auditability, supports multi-user management, and provides a path toward decentralized orchestration.

## Progressive Decentralization

While initial deployment may rely on centralized services, the system is designed to evolve toward:

- Community-hosted validators and routers;
- Subcloud governance and peer moderation;
- On-chain reward logic and token distribution;
- Snapshot-based reproducibility and portable deployment.

Each layer can be independently replaced, mirrored, or decentralized without compromising the rest of the system.

Resultity prioritizes composability, robustness, and upgrade paths — not just performance or minimalism — to support long-term operation as a public inference network.
