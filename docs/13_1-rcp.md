# 13.1 RCP: Resultity Contribution Points

RCP (Resultity Contribution Points) is the core contribution and reward metric within the Resultity ecosystem.

It serves to incentivize valuable participation across both the **Testnet** and **Mainnet**, providing a foundation for token allocation, network privileges, and governance eligibility.

---

## What is RCP

RCP reflects the **usefulness, stability, and involvement** of a participant — primarily node operators, but also testers, referrers, API consumers, and contributors across the ecosystem.

It is not a token, but a **non-transferable contribution score**, granted for validated actions and auditable behaviors.

## RCP Lifecycle

### Phase 1 — Testnet Rewards

During the Resultity Testnet phase, RCP is earned for:

- Running nodes and maintaining uptime;
- Participating in inference tests and generating load;
- Solving Honesty Checks and performing model verification;
- Submitting feedback and reporting edge cases;
- Referring node operators or inference users;
- Contributing to docs, localization, or community outreach.

All such actions are **logged, timestamped**, and associated with the user or node ID.  
RCP is calculated using **snapshot-based issuance**, with data available via the dashboard.

### Phase 2 — Mainnet Launch and TGE

At Mainnet and Token Generation Event (TGE), a one-time **conversion event** will allow Testnet RCP holders to receive $RTITY tokens.  
The amount will be based on contribution score, epoch data, and network rules.

### Phase 3 — Stimulated Contribution Mining

After TGE, Resultity introduces **ongoing RCP mining** with decaying rewards:

- Each epoch allocates a portion of $RTITY tokens to contributors based on new RCP earned;
- Any verifiable network role can generate RCP: nodes, referrals, consumption, moderation, or community input;
- Periodic **incentive drops** convert eligible RCP into tokens.

This allows continued contribution without central allocation, and encourages long-term engagement.

## Design Principles

- **Fairness** — rewards are issued via blind tests, snapshots, or backend validation;
- **Decaying emissions** — incentives favor early and sustained contributors;
- **Inclusivity** — non-technical roles (e.g. community or content contributors) can also earn RCP;
- **Auditability** — all rewards are tied to observable events and retained in history.

---

## RCP Utility

RCP balances can unlock:

- **Token conversion** — direct swap into $RTITY at defined events;
- **Access tiers** — priority to Subclouds, beta features, or special roles;
- **Routing preferences** — job queue optimization or faster inference;
- **DAO participation** — eligibility for voting and proposal creation.

RCP is the foundation of a merit-based reward system that evolves alongside the Resultity ecosystem.
