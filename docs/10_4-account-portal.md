# Account Portal

The **Account Portal** (`account.resultity.com`) serves as the central identity and management hub for all Resultity users.  
It consolidates user credentials, referral tracking, activity logs, and upcoming collaborative features under a unified interface.

- Switch between accounts if multiple identities are present;
- View authentication history and last login timestamp.

## Referral Program

- Access your unique referral link;
- View referral statistics:
  - Number of referred users;
  - Activation and job completion metrics;
  - Credit or RCP rewards (when applicable);
- Monitor campaign-based bonuses and milestones.

## Activity Overview

- Track personal usage statistics (credits spent, jobs submitted);
- Monitor reward accumulation during testnet or campaigns;
- Export basic logs and activity summaries.

## Upcoming: Team Management

Planned features for team collaboration include:

- Creating and joining **Teams**;
