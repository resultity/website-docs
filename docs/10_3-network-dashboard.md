# Network Dashboard

The **Network Dashboard** (`network.resultity.com`) is the main interface for node operators participating in the Resultity network.  
It provides tools for managing node lifecycle, synchronizing software versions, tracking performance, and engaging with testnet tasks.

This dashboard is tailored for those contributing compute power to the decentralized network — from home GPU providers to professional infrastructure hosts.

## Node Management

- Register new nodes and bind them to an account;
- View node status (online/offline, load, last heartbeat);
- Update node configurations;
- Sync node software with the latest approved version;
- Trigger manual restarts or reloads if needed.

## Model Management

- Install supported models from central registry;
- Monitor model size, version, and compatibility;
- Remove or update models as new releases are available.

## Job Logs and Performance

- View history of executed jobs (ID, latency, tokens, status);
- Visualize performance metrics per node or per model;
- Flag anomalies and outliers (planned).

## Auto-Sync System

- Nodes automatically check in with the central configuration server;
- Periodic updates pushed for runtime, models, and agent settings;
- Optional manual override for testing or custom configs.

## Testnet Tools

Available only when the dashboard is switched to **Testnet** mode:

- **Verification Jobs** — perform validation tasks to earn test rewards;
- **Leaderboards** — compare node activity and uptime;
- **RCP Earnings** — track testnet point accumulation;
- **Error Reports** — submit logs for debugging and support;
- **Honesty Checks and Manual Checks** — additional interactive validation tasks.

The Network Dashboard streamlines node operations and enables transparency, diagnostics, and reward tracking for all contributors to Resultity's decentralized compute layer.
