# Referrals

The Resultity platform includes a **referral system** that rewards users for bringing new participants into the network. Referrals help expand both supply (nodes) and demand (API usage).

## How It Works

Each account has a unique referral link. When a new user signs up using that link:

- They are permanently associated with the referrer;
- The referrer receives rewards based on the referred user's activity.

Referral logic is **off-chain**, tracked in the account backend.

## Reward Types

Referrers may receive:

- **Bonus credits** based on the spending or uptime of referred users;
- **RCP (Resultity Contribution Points)** for leaderboard participation or future conversions;
- **Special rewards** during campaigns, airdrops, or launch events.

Reward amounts and conditions may change per epoch or campaign.

## Visibility

- Referral stats are shown in the account dashboard;
- Includes total referred users, activity summaries, and pending payouts;
- Some campaigns may offer **delayed** or **milestone-based** rewards (e.g., "after first job", "after $10 spend").

## Payout Handling

Referral payouts (when in credits) are automatically added to the namespace of the referrer. Other types (e.g. RCP or token-based) may follow different rules depending on network epoch and on-chain status.

## Notes

Referrals are linked to the account level â€” not individual keys or namespaces. Abuse (e.g., self-referrals or Sybil attacks) is monitored and may lead to disqualification.
