# Governance and Updates

As Resultity progresses toward decentralization, governance mechanisms will gradually shift from backend coordination to community-driven decision-making. This transition will be implemented through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), responsible for key network operations and protocol evolution.

Until full decentralization, decisions are coordinated by the core team, with backend enforcement and open community input.

---

## Governance Scope

The DAO will manage:

- **Protocol upgrades**  
  Proposing and approving updates to central services, agent logic, and public APIs;

- **Parameter tuning**  
  Adjusting values such as token inference pricing, epoch lengths, staking thresholds, and reward curves;

- **Treasury and ecosystem grants**  
  Allocating funds for infrastructure development, partner programs, or liquidity initiatives;

- **Subcloud registry**  
  Managing public Subclouds, verifying node clusters, and curating trusted datasets.

## Governance Mechanics (Planned)

The governance system will use an on-chain, EVM-compatible voting mechanism. Key parameters:

- **Voter classes**  
  - Token holders;  
  - Verified node operators;  
  - Contributors with high RCP balance;

- **Voting rules**  
  - Configurable quorum thresholds;  
  - Fixed or dynamic voting periods;  
  - Majority types: simple, supermajority, or weighted;

- **Delegation and staking**  
  Planned support for delegated voting and vote-weighted staking systems;

- **Slashing and enforcement**  
  Optional rules for penalizing malicious actors or inactive validators (e.g., downgrade, vote freeze).

Governance logic will be defined via a consensus profile stored in the systemâ€™s versioned config registry.

## Transition to Decentralization

Governance will roll out in phases:

1. **Pre-Governance**  
   Core team coordinates updates with community feedback via dashboards and status channels;

2. **Token-Based Voting**  
   Voting power based on staked $RTITY tokens with proposal registry and snapshot validation;

3. **Full DAO Deployment**  
   Migration to smart contracts and autonomous governance, including treasury control and protocol updates.

This phased approach allows Resultity to remain agile during the early growth stage, while laying a solid foundation for long-term transparency and fairness.
