# Cloud Dashboard

The **Cloud Dashboard** (`cloud.resultity.com`) is the primary interface for users interacting with the Resultity inference API.  
It is designed for developers, researchers, and integrators who submit jobs, manage billing, and monitor model usage.

This panel serves as the control center for all **API-facing activities**, including access control, request statistics, and Subcloud participation.
