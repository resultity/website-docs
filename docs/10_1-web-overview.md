# Web Applications Overview

User interaction with the Resultity infrastructure occurs through a set of specialized web applications.  
Each application serves a distinct role — from inference and billing to node management and model deployment — while remaining unified under a single user account system.

All panels support both **Mainnet** and **Testnet**, with a network toggle available per session.  
This enables safe testing and progressive adoption of production features without switching environments.

---

## Unified Account System

- All applications use the same account credentials (email and/or EVM wallet);
- Sessions are shared across apps where possible;
- Activity and rewards are synced between dashboards;
- Security features such as 2FA and session revocation (planned) will apply globally.

---

## Purpose of Web Interfaces

The platform provides several interfaces tailored to user roles:

- **Cloud Dashboard** — for API consumers and developers;
- **Network Dashboard** — for node operators and infrastructure contributors;
- **Account Portal** — for identity, keys, and referrals;
- **Space Portal** — for agents, models, and automation;
- **Status Explorer** — for public transparency and analytics.

Each app is a standalone panel but shares data through the Resultity Core backend and synced APIs.

## Notifications and Assistant

A Telegram-based assistant (with future extension to WhatsApp and Discord) will be integrated for key user events:

- Node status updates;
- Inference task completions;
- New deployments in Space;
- Financial transactions and rewards.

This ensures real-time awareness without constant dashboard access.

The Resultity web layer is designed to offer full transparency, control, and visibility — from infrastructure to APIs — while preserving ease of use and modular separation of concerns.
