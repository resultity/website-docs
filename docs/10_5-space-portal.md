# Space Portal

The **Space Portal** (`space.resultity.com`) is designed for advanced users, teams, and integrators who wish to deploy and manage AI agents, inference pipelines, vector databases, and automations.  
It serves as the foundation for building custom logic, automating tasks, and offering services within the Resultity ecosystem.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **Agent Deployment**  
  Upload and configure custom agents powered by language models or task-specific logic.

- **Model Management**  
  Use public models or upload your own fine-tuned models for isolated execution within Subclouds or Space instances.

- **Inference Pipelines**  
  Chain models, prompts, and tools together to create structured processing flows (e.g., RAG, classification, moderation).

- **Vector Storage**  
  Manage vector databases for embedding-based search, memory, and long-term context.

- **Templates and Presets**  
  Define reusable task flows or prompt templates to accelerate development and maintain consistency.

## Marketplace

A curated interface for:

- Sharing and discovering **agents**, **pipelines**, and **Subclouds**;
- Cloning and adapting community-created configurations;
- Showcasing models or services (e.g., for enterprise adoption or monetization in the future).

---

## Use Cases

- Hosting autonomous AI agents;
- Deploying private inference flows (e.g., legal summarization, support bots);
- Offering specialized services to other Resultity users via Subclouds;
- Internal workflows and automations for organizations;
- Building end-to-end applications that integrate LLMs with external tools.

The Space Portal transforms Resultity from a compute network into a programmable AI environment â€” enabling both individual productivity and scalable integrations.
