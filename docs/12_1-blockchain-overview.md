# Blockchain and Tokenization

The Resultity platform progressively integrates blockchain technologies to provide verifiable payments, secure identity, and decentralized governance.

This layer complements the core server-side infrastructure and is always monitored by backend services for integrity and synchronization.  
Blockchain is not used for real-time operations but serves as a verification and accountability layer.

## Key Objectives

- **Payment infrastructure**  
  Support for token-based payments, starting with credits purchasable via stablecoins, and evolving to $RTITY token usage after TGE;

- **Reward conversion**  
  RCP (Resultity Contribution Points), earned by nodes and participants, will be convertible into $RTITY tokens at defined epochs or snapshot periods;

- **Identity and signature verification**  
  Use of EVM-compatible cryptographic signatures to validate ownership and commands, both for API access and internal coordination (e.g., network-issued tasks or node-initiated updates);

- **On-chain tracking (planned)**  
  Staking, voting rights, and historical contribution logs can be recorded on-chain for transparency and decentralization;

- **Escrow mechanics**  
  Tokens or credits may be locked during job processing and released upon successful completion, ensuring fairness between clients and nodes.

## Progressive Integration

1. **Pre-TGE**  
   - Credits used internally, topped up with stablecoins;
   - Off-chain RCP accumulation;
   - EVM key binding and signature verification for accounts and nodes.

2. **Post-TGE**  
   - $RTITY token becomes primary means of payment;
   - RCP-to-token conversion enabled;
   - Tokenized staking, rewards, and escrow.

3. **Mainnet Maturity**  
   - DAO governance based on token holdings and/or participation;
   - On-chain tracking of node performance and voting records.

The blockchain layer is designed to enhance — not replace — the fast, off-chain infrastructure of Resultity.  
Its purpose is to ensure **credibility, traceability, and decentralization**, while maintaining performance and usability.
